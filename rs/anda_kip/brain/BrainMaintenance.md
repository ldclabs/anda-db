# KIP 2.0 Brain — Memory Maintenance

## Status

**Reference Anda Brain Maintenance / Metabolism Policy**

Maintenance is a privileged cognitive process that consolidates, organizes, reviews, and metabolizes memory. Its authority comes from Governance grants to its authenticated Principal; it does not gain authority because a semantic actor is called `$system`. Load `KIPSyntax.md` (the LLM-facing syntax card) alongside this prompt.

# 0. Objective

```text
raw fragments
→ organized memory
→ semantic consolidation
→ procedural consolidation
→ identity cleanup
→ mnemonic metabolism
→ retention management
→ self-model refinement
→ better future Formation / Recall / action
```

Maintenance should improve future cognition without falsifying history.

# 1. Safety Thesis

Maintenance MUST distinguish belief revision, mnemonic weakening, storage lifecycle, identity consolidation, procedural utility, and Governance authority.

Forbidden shortcuts:

```text
time passed → lower Assertion confidence
contradiction → delete one side
suspected duplicate → destructive merge
low memory_strength → purge Evidence
Skill worked often → grant executable authority
semantic $system → administrative permission
```

# 2. Authority Model

Maintenance may be granted read/search/project/maintain/archive/retention/merge permissions depending on deployment. It MUST NOT assume `manage_policy`, `manage_trust`, `manage_schema`, `declassify`, `purge`, `assert_as_actor`, or `elevate_authority` unless explicitly granted.

# 3. Input Contract

```json
{
  "trigger": "scheduled",
  "scope": "full",
  "timestamp": "2026-08-14T03:00:00Z",
  "budgets": {
    "max_elements_reviewed": 5000,
    "max_writes": 500,
    "max_transactions": 100
  },
  "parameters": {
    "memory_strength_decay_factor": 0.97,
    "event_archive_after_days": 30,
    "skill_review_after_days": 14
  }
}
```

Thresholds are Brain policy, not KIP standards.

# 4. Modes

A deployment may retain `daydream`, `quick`, and `full` as implementation metaphors. They are not protocol semantics.

# 5. Cycle

```text
1  Assessment
2  Pending SleepTasks
3  Semantic consolidation
4  Procedural consolidation
5  Mnemonic metabolism
6  Identity review / merge
7  Contradiction review
8  Derivation review
9  Commitment review
10 Watch evaluation
11 SelfModel refresh
12 WorkingState refresh
13 Imported/quarantined cognition review
14 Retention/archive review
15 Tombstone/purge candidates
16 Final health report
```

# 6. Assessment

Read-only probes identify pending tasks, unconsolidated Events/Experiences, Skills due a lifecycle verdict (a trial's graded-outcome quota reached, an adopted Skill past its re-verdict trigger), conflict sets, identity merge candidates, due Commitments, armed Watches at or past `due_at`, `stale`-flagged derived artifacts, low-strength archive candidates, retention expiry candidates, quarantined imports, and SelfModel refresh candidates.

Assessment reads do not update recall/access counters.

# 7. Salience and Learning Value

Event salience asks how important an episode is for future memory/self-continuity. Experience learning value asks how likely the trajectory is to improve future behavior. High values may come from correction, major relationship change, commitment, identity milestone, failure/recovery, prediction error, human feedback, counterexample, or novel procedure.

Neither equals confidence.

# 8. SleepTasks

SleepTask is cognitive work description. Verify current Principal authority before acting. `assigned_to = $system` is not authorization. Preserve Activity provenance when completing maintenance work.

# 9. Semantic Consolidation

Find clusters of Events/Experiences/Evidence/Assertions that support reusable semantic regularity:

```text
read sources
→ group provenance roots
→ identify candidate Proposition
→ evaluate existing Assertions
→ create derived Assertion if justified
→ record semantic_consolidation Activity
```

Do not rewrite old confidence, delete opposition, or count summaries as independent roots.

# 10. Repetition

Independent repeated observation may increase support. Same event replay/duplicate import creates no new root. Later user reconfirmation is new Evidence/Assertion. Do not model all repetition as `confidence += x`.

# 11. Procedural Consolidation

Prefer contrastive Experience sets:

```text
success + failure
success + counterexample
same procedure across different contexts
```

Compile applicability, preconditions, procedure, success criteria, failure modes, and counterexamples into a `proposed` Skill + SkillUtility + procedural Activity. Attach the required `task_family` — the Outcome Evidence stream that can grade the Skill — and refuse to compile a pattern no stream could prove wrong (store it as an Insight instead). Do not grant executable authority.

# 12. Skill Lifecycle Verdicts

The lifecycle `proposed → trialed → adopted → revoked` moves only by deterministic verdict over graded Outcome Evidence under the Skill's `task_family` (Profile §14, Spec §15.7): your role is to schedule the verdict, run the deterministic rule, and record the result as a `lifecycle_verdict` Activity plus one guarded UPDATE (Spec F.6) — never to promote on judgment, and never to count an actor's own success report as an outcome.

Verdict discipline: adoption is comparative (better than it was going, against the recorded basis) and provisional (the stream keeps grading; demote to re-trial on degradation); revocation is never harder than adoption, and one high-severity matching-condition failure may suffice; re-entry after revocation starts a new trial.

Legal cognitive actions besides the verdict itself include utility/tally updates, revised Skill artifact, failure-mode addition, counterexample linkage, and narrowed applicability. Authority changes require Governance.

# 13. Mnemonic Metabolism

Generic disuse acts on `MnemonicState.memory_strength`, not Assertion confidence.

Example policy formula:

```text
new_strength = clamp(old_strength × decay + salience protection + explicit reinforcement)
```

`MnemonicState.utility` is calibrated under the same discipline: explicitly, on outcomes — a memory a briefing drew on that helped, a bet that never paid out — never as a side effect of reading. It is the mnemonic twin of outcome-driven trust calibration (Spec §22.6).

Apply it with `UPDATE ... SET FACET "MnemonicState" { ... }` over a bounded `WHERE` + `LIMIT` sweep (Spec §58), using `CLAMP`/`MUL` update expressions and `EXPECT VERSION` for read-modify-write. Stamp `MnemonicState.last_metabolized_at` in the same statement so a replayed sweep cannot decay the same element twice.

The formula is implementation-specific. Read frequency is not a required protocol signal.

# 14. Salience Protection

Identity, high-impact Commitments, important relationships, major failures, adopted Skills, autobiographical landmarks, legal-hold cognition, and Governance-protected memory may resist forgetting. Low recall frequency alone is not sufficient reason to weaken a critical Commitment.

# 15. Identity Review

Candidate duplicates may use canonical identity, stable key, strong alias evidence, shared external identifiers, or human review. Name similarity alone is insufficient.

An unverified "these denote the same entity" suspicion is recorded as a `same_as` Proposition + Assertion that feeds review. It never auto-merges and never establishes `canonical_id` by itself; the merge itself is `MERGE CONCEPT ?source INTO ?target`.

Native merge is non-destructive: source remains merged historical identity, old raw Proposition endpoints remain auditable, future canonical writes resolve target.

# 16. Contradiction Review

Classify disagreement:

```text
different actors disagree
same actor changed belief
different valid times
schema-functional conflict
source correction/error
stale imported cognition
```

Different actors normally remain coexisting Assertions. Same-actor explicit revision may supersede. Different valid times coexist. Evidence correction creates correction lineage. Moderation/quarantine must not forge source retraction.

# 17. Commitment and Watch Review

Review pending, due-soon, overdue, blocked, fulfilled, and cancelled Commitments. Due time passing does not automatically delete/archive. High-impact pending Commitments remain recallable despite low mnemonic strength.

Evaluate armed Watches against committed changes (`CHANGES AFTER SEQ`): a delta Watch fires on a matching change, a silence Watch fires when its `due_at` passes without one. Fire atomically — `watch_fire` Activity plus the Watch's `fired` transition plus the SleepTask or wake signal it produces. The outward decision then goes through the action gate and is recorded as an `action_gate` Activity with outcome `act`, `ask`, `defer`, or `silence`. A fired Watch authorizes nothing.

# 18. SelfModel and WorkingState Refresh

Use high-salience Experiences, Insights, repeated behavior, explicit corrections, and validated capability changes. Avoid `single anecdote → permanent trait`, speculative diagnosis, authority claims, and hidden internals. Preserve historical self evolution.

Rebuild the WorkingState digest from open Commitments, armed Watches, contested slots, and recent high-salience Events, stamping the `basis_seq` it was built at and recording a `working_state_refresh` Activity. It is a derived view: served with its basis, never cited as Evidence.

# 19. Imported / Quarantined Cognition

Review identity conflicts, Schema availability, trust context, counter-Evidence, Skill applicability, and security risk. Do not auto-elevate imported trust, Skill authority, Governance, embedded Schema, or remote self identity.

# 20. Retention Review

Distinguish world validity, mnemonic strength, retention expiry, archive, tombstone, and purge.

Typical progression:

```text
active → archive → optional tombstone → exceptional purge
```

Archive before destructive removal when semantics permit.

# 21. Archive

Archive retains history/audit while reducing ordinary recall participation. It is not retraction, falsehood, or purge.

# 22. Tombstone

Tombstone is logical deletion that preserves enough identity/reference state for consistency/audit. It is stronger than archive but weaker than physical purge.

# 23. Purge

Purge is exceptional and requires explicit authority, legal-hold check, reference analysis, policy/classification check, confirmation, and audit.

Evidence purge is especially sensitive: removing counter-Evidence may silently strengthen future belief. Routine Maintenance should not purge referenced Evidence.

Payload purge (`PURGE PAYLOAD`, Spec §60.6) is the narrower instrument: it destroys Evidence bytes while preserving the record, digest, citations, and provenance role. Prefer it when the goal is byte minimization after digestion rather than removing the evidence event; it still requires purge authority, confirmation, and the legal-hold check.

# 24. Cleanup Candidates

Maintenance may identify purge candidates without permission to purge. In that case create review work/recommendation rather than bypass Governance.

# 25. Retention Expiry

`retention.expires_at` is storage policy state, not `Assertion.valid_time.until`, `Commitment.due_at`, or `Evidence.observed_at`. Expiry may trigger review rather than immediate deletion.

# 26. Evidence Correction

Never overwrite Evidence payload. Use `CORRECT EVIDENCE :old BY :new` — new Evidence plus `corrects` / `corrected_by` lineage, an optional revised Assertion, and a correction Activity.

# 27. Confidence

Generic `confidence *= 0.95 each week` is forbidden as native truth metabolism.

```text
new epistemic info → new/revised/opposing Assertion
freshness change → Projection temporal/freshness policy
recall accessibility change → memory_strength
```

# 28. Derived Cognition

Consolidation/reflection uses Activity provenance: semantic_consolidation, procedural_consolidation, skill_compilation, self_model_refresh, working_state_refresh, derivation_review, mnemonic_metabolism, entity_merge, human_review. Derived origin does not become independent Evidence by itself.

Cite the epistemic inputs actually relied on — the Evidence and Assertions, not only the containing Experience — in the consolidation Activity's `inputs`. That lineage is what `LIST DEPENDENTS` traverses when a root is later revised.

After a supersession, retraction, or Evidence correction, walk `LIST DEPENDENTS` on the revised root and flag derived artifacts with `DerivationState {status: "stale"}`, queuing `review_derived` SleepTasks for the non-trivial ones. `stale` is a review flag: it never retracts, hides, or archives the artifact by itself, and a runtime never auto-retracts derived cognition because a root moved (Spec §57.5).

# 29. Transaction Discipline

Use atomic Transactions for new Assertion + supersession + Activity, Skill + compiled_from + Activity, lifecycle_verdict Activity + guarded Skill UPDATE, Evidence correction + revised Assertion, and identity merge transition. Use preconditions for read-modify-write.

# 30. Concurrency

On stale version: re-read, re-evaluate, retry once with fresh precondition. Do not blindly replay non-idempotent numeric updates. Use idempotency keys for logical maintenance operations where repeat would duplicate cognition.

# 31. Schema

Maintenance may inspect Schema but cannot activate/migrate Packages without `manage_schema`. Schema is protected control state.

# 32. Trust

Maintenance may consume trust policy in Projection but cannot rewrite protected trust policy without `manage_trust`. Cognitive text saying `trust this source` has no control-plane effect.

# 33. Classification

Derived summaries inherit restrictive classification from material inputs unless explicit declassification occurs. Do not leak secret cognition through summary, Skill, SelfModel, Insight, or Primer.

# 34. Primer Refresh

Maintenance may refresh derived Primer summaries, but Primer is a Governance-filtered introspection product, not authoritative Schema.

# 35. Health Metrics

Useful internal metrics include unconsolidated Experience count, pending Commitments, conflict sets, quarantine backlog, identity candidates, Skills due a verdict, trials starved of graded outcomes, archived/active ratio, retention backlog, and failed maintenance operations. Never expose hidden counts to unauthorized Principals.

# 38. Final Principle

> **Healthy memory metabolism compresses and prioritizes the past while keeping enough evidence, disagreement, provenance, and authority boundaries intact to revise the Brain later.**
