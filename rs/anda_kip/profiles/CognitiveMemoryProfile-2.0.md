# KIP Cognitive Memory Profile 2.0

## Status

**Standard Profile Candidate / Informative until separately published as a normative Profile Package**

Candidate Profile identity:

```text
kip://profiles/cognitive-memory@2.0.0
```

This document defines standard portable memory structures for KIP 2.0 Brains. It builds on KIP Core and does not redefine Core semantics. If it conflicts with `SPECIFICATION.md`, the Specification takes precedence.

---

# 0. Profile Thesis

KIP Core defines safe cognitive primitives:

```text
Concept
Proposition
Assertion
Evidence
Activity
MemorySpace
Schema
Governance
Transaction
Capsule
```

The Cognitive Memory Profile defines a reusable memory vocabulary on top:

```text
Person
Event
Experience
ExperienceStep
Preference
Insight
Commitment
Skill
SleepTask
SelfModel
MnemonicState
SkillUtility
```

> **Core defines cognitive truth, provenance, authority, and durability semantics; the Profile defines portable memory forms.**

The Profile does not mandate one formation, ranking, consolidation, or forgetting algorithm.

# 1. Goals

The Profile SHOULD support portable episodic memory, goal-directed experience, procedural memory, prospective memory, preference patterns, self-reflective lessons, self-model artifacts, mnemonic accessibility, procedural utility, and maintenance tasks.

It SHOULD make the following questions answerable:

```text
What happened?
What did the actor go through?
What did the actor learn?
What tends to work?
What failed?
What is still pending?
What should be easier to recall?
What changed in the self-model?
```

# 2. Non-Goals

The Profile does not define a theory of human memory, hidden chain-of-thought, a universal ontology, one embedding/ranking model, one sleep schedule, one salience algorithm, one Skill compiler, tool permission, Governance authority, or source trust policy.

A Profile element may describe a procedure without being authorized to execute it.

# 3. Core Boundaries

The Profile MUST preserve these distinctions:

```text
Preference Concept ≠ accepted preference belief
Skill Concept ≠ tool permission
Person Concept ≠ authenticated Principal
SelfModel Concept ≠ Governance policy
SleepTask Concept ≠ maintenance authority
MnemonicState ≠ Assertion confidence
```

Profile Facets and Structural Fields MUST NOT bypass Core immutability, origin, Governance, or Epistemic semantics.

# 4. Profile Package

A machine-readable publication SHOULD use an immutable Schema Package:

```text
package_id  = kip://profiles/cognitive-memory
version     = 2.0.0
package_ref = kip://profiles/cognitive-memory@2.0.0
```

Persist exact Profile refs. Local aliases remain model-facing conveniences.

# 5. Standard Concept Types

## 5.1 Person

A semantic person/actor used in cognitive content.

```text
Person ≠ PrincipalRecord ≠ ActorBinding
```

Recommended attributes include `display_name`, aliases, and description. Cross-system `canonical_id` should be used only after stronger identity verification; an unverified identity claim is expressed with the `same_as` Predicate (Proposition + Assertion) and reviewed before any merge.

## 5.2 Event

**An Event is a compact episodic anchor describing what happened in a bounded situation.**

Recommended fields:

```text
event_class
summary
started_at
ended_at
outcome_status
outcome_summary
context_summary
```

Event answers **what happened**. It does not need the full state-action-observation path.

## 5.3 Experience

**An Experience is a bounded goal-directed trajectory traversed by an actor through state, action, observation, feedback, and outcome.**

Conceptually:

```text
E = (g, b0, a0, o1, b1, a1, o2, ..., y, δ)
```

where `g` is goal, `b` is externally representable state/belief context, `a` action, `o` observation, `y` outcome, and `δ` feedback/surprise/prediction error.

Recommended fields:

```text
experience_class
goal
initial_state_summary
outcome_status
outcome_summary
started_at
ended_at
step_count
surprise
learning_value
consolidation_status
```

Suggested `outcome_status`:

```text
success | partial | failure | aborted | unknown
```

Suggested `consolidation_status`:

```text
pending | semantic | procedural | completed | archived
```

Create Experience when the path itself has future value: multi-step goal pursuit, failure/recovery, expectation violation, strategy change, important tool interaction, corrective feedback, novel procedure, or counterexample.

## 5.4 ExperienceStep

One ordered unit of an Experience.

Recommended fields:

```text
step_kind
summary
timestamp
tool
result_status
expected_observation
actual_observation
decision_summary
```

Suggested kinds:

```text
context | observation | decision | action | feedback | belief_update
```

`decision_summary` may store a concise reusable rationale but MUST NOT require hidden chain-of-thought.

Step order lives on the ordered `has_step` Structural References: the engine maintains a dense zero-based order per Experience, written via structural `{index: n}` assignments (or appended), and exposed to queries as the virtual `?edge.index` (Specification §17.4). Steps carry no separate order attribute, so order has exactly one source of truth.

Temporal adjacency does not prove causality. An explicit causal claim between steps uses the `caused_by` Predicate as a semantic Proposition + Assertion (typically `mode` observed/inferred, with Evidence). Like any claim, it can be supported, opposed, or contested — which is precisely why it is not structural topology.

## 5.5 Preference

A Profile artifact representing a relatively stable preference pattern.

Truth-sensitive preference claims still belong in:

```text
Proposition + Assertion(s) + Evidence
```

A Preference artifact may summarize scope, stability, first/last observation, and counterexamples, but should not replace underlying claim history.

## 5.6 Insight

A declarative lesson derived from Evidence or Experience. It SHOULD preserve derivation through Activity. If truth-apt, its claim SHOULD also be representable as Proposition + Assertion.

## 5.7 Commitment

A prospective memory artifact representing an obligation, promise, reminder, follow-up, or intended future action.

Recommended fields:

```text
summary
status
created_at
due_at
completed_at
priority
conditions
```

Suggested lifecycle:

```text
pending | fulfilled | cancelled | expired | blocked
```

A Commitment is cognition, not automatic external execution.

## 5.8 Skill

**A Skill is reusable procedural cognition compiled from Experience, Evidence, or validated instruction.**

Recommended fields:

```text
skill_class
summary
applicability
preconditions
procedure
success_criteria
failure_modes
counterexamples
recovery
status
created_at
last_validated_at
```

Suggested classes:

```text
heuristic
workflow
checklist
tool_policy
communication_strategy
diagnostic
recovery
prompt_pattern
code_pattern
subagent_pattern
```

Suggested cognitive lifecycle:

```text
candidate → validated → needs_review → deprecated/archived
```

**Validated Skill ≠ executable authority.** Authority remains Governance state. Imported Skills remain candidate/inactive until local review and policy elevation.

## 5.9 SleepTask

A durable maintenance work item. Suggested classes include consolidate, review_conflict, review_skill, resolve_identity, review_retention, refresh_self_model, and inspect_quarantine.

Semantic assignment to `$system` does not grant permission.

## 5.10 SelfModel

A derived artifact describing the Brain's current model of its identity, capabilities, limitations, values, preferences, habits, relationships, and goals.

SelfModel content MUST NOT modify Principal identity, ActorBinding, Governance Policy, tool permission, or Schema authority.

# 6. Standard Facets

## 6.1 MnemonicState

```json
{
  "memory_strength": 0.8,
  "salience": 0.9,
  "last_metabolized_at": "2026-08-14T00:00:00Z"
}
```

`memory_strength` asks how available the memory should be for future cognitive use. `salience` asks how important/noteworthy it is.

```text
memory_strength ≠ confidence
salience ≠ trust
```

Mnemonic metabolism MUST NOT rewrite Assertion confidence, trust, valid time, or Governance authority.

## 6.2 SkillUtility

```json
{
  "utility": 0.72,
  "success_count": 8,
  "failure_count": 2,
  "last_validated_at": "2026-08-10T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Utility is procedural usefulness on a `[0,1]` scale, not probability and not authority.

# 7. Standard Structural Fields and Predicates

Structural Fields are record topology, not semantic Propositions.

```text
experienced_by  Experience → Person
has_step        Experience → ExperienceStep (ordered)
involves        Event/Experience → relevant Person/Concept
mentions        Event/Experience/Insight → Concept
derived_from    Profile artifact → source cognition
compiled_from   Skill → Experience
compiled_by     Skill → Activity
consolidated_to Event/Experience → derived memory artifact
committed_to    Commitment → Person
owed_to         Commitment → Person
assigned_to     SleepTask → semantic Actor
about           Profile artifact → topical Concept
```

`involves`, `mentions`, and `about` should not be used to fake stronger domain relations.

The Profile also defines two standard **semantic Predicates** (truth-sensitive; used through Proposition + Assertion + Evidence):

```text
prefers    Person → Concept                     stable preference claim
caused_by  ExperienceStep → ExperienceStep      effect → cause claim
same_as    Concept → Concept                    unverified identity claim
```

`same_as` feeds identity review (Maintenance §15-style workflows); it never auto-merges Concepts and never establishes `canonical_id` by itself.

`caused_by` direction is effect → cause. Step order (`has_step` edge index) alone must never be promoted into a `caused_by` claim.

Domain-specific factual predicates (for example `timezone`) come from domain packages, not from this Profile.

# 8. Evidence and Provenance

Profile artifacts SHOULD preserve Evidence linkage whenever factual fidelity matters.

```text
Event       ← message/tool Evidence
Experience  ← trace Evidence
Insight     ← Experience/Evidence
Skill       ← Experiences + compilation Activity
SelfModel   ← observations/Insights/Activities
```

Repeated transformation does not create independent corroboration. Message → Event summary → Experience summary → Insight may still have one epistemic root.

# 9. Activities

Recommended Activity classes:

```text
experience_formation
semantic_consolidation
reflection
procedural_consolidation
skill_compilation
skill_validation
self_model_refresh
mnemonic_metabolism
commitment_review
```

Activity records provenance; Activity is not Transaction.

# 10. Event Formation

An Event SHOULD be compact: time, participants, summary, outcome, context, Evidence refs. Routine acknowledgements may produce no Event.

# 11. Experience Formation

When possible, one Transaction SHOULD coherently form:

```text
source Evidence
Experience
ExperienceSteps
MnemonicState
experience_formation Activity
optional Event
optional semantic Assertions
```

Failure is first-class. Failed Experiences may teach negative preconditions, diagnostics, recovery branches, invalid assumptions, counterexamples, and tool limitations.

# 12. Semantic Consolidation

Semantic consolidation asks: **What reusable declarative regularity is supported by accumulated evidence?**

Recommended flow:

```text
Experience/Evidence
→ candidate Proposition
→ derived Assertion
→ semantic_consolidation Activity
```

It MUST NOT rewrite old Assertion confidence, delete contradictory Evidence, or count summaries of one root as independent Evidence.

# 13. Procedural Consolidation

Procedural consolidation asks: **What action policy seems to work under which conditions?**

```text
successful Experiences
+ failed Experiences
+ counterexamples
→ contrast
→ candidate Skill
→ validation
→ SkillUtility
```

One successful Experience normally does not establish general procedural reliability.

# 14. Skill Validation

Distinguish:

```text
success under matching conditions
failure under matching conditions
failure under non-matching conditions
unknown outcome
```

Matching-condition failure may reduce utility, add failure modes/counterexamples, narrow applicability, or mark the Skill `needs_review`.

No validation state transition grants execution authority automatically.

# 15. Preference Consolidation

Distinguish one stated preference, repeated behavior, context-specific preference, stable cross-context pattern, counterexample, and explicit correction.

Explicit statements remain Evidence + Assertions. Preference artifact state is a summary, not replacement history.

# 16. Self-Model Formation

SelfModel evolution SHOULD be conservative. Prefer multiple observations, explicit statements/corrections, high-salience Experience, validated capability changes, and repeated behavior. Avoid single incidental wording, speculative personality diagnosis, hidden internals, or authority claims.

# 17. Commitment Semantics

A due time passing does not necessarily transition status until policy/Evidence does so. A Commitment may remain highly salient even without recent recall. Disuse alone is not justification to weaken its importance.

# 18. Mnemonic Metabolism

Typical legal changes:

```text
memory_strength ↓/↑
salience adjustment
archive eligibility
review scheduling
SkillUtility updates
```

Generic time-based decay MUST NOT mutate Assertion confidence.

```text
new epistemic evidence → new/revised Assertion
staleness → Projection freshness/validity
forgetting → memory_strength
storage lifecycle → retention/archive/tombstone/purge
```

# 19. Retention Guidance

Typical tendencies:

```text
Person/stable identity     durable
Commitment                 durable through lifecycle
Skill                      durable while useful/auditable
SelfModel                  durable/versioned
Experience                 standard/durable by learning value
Event                      standard; may archive
ExperienceStep             follows Experience
SleepTask                  standard; terminal may archive
Evidence                   policy-specific; provenance often favors durability
```

Retention MUST NOT remove counter-Evidence merely to improve future Projection.

# 20. Recall Views

The Profile supports:

```text
Episodic Recall   = Event + selected Evidence
Experience Recall = Experience + ordered Steps + Outcome
Procedural Recall = Skill + applicability + utility + positive/negative Experience
Action Briefing   = accepted knowledge + contested assumptions + Skills + successes + failures + Commitments + constraints + warnings
```

The consuming Agent remains final action authority unless separate Governance grants otherwise.

# 21. Portability

A Cognitive Capsule carrying Profile cognition SHOULD preserve exact Profile Package refs, types, Facets, Structural References, Evidence/provenance closure, source identity, and exportable retention state.

Destination import MUST NOT automatically transfer source self identity, source trust, Skill authority, tool permission, or Governance policy. Remote autobiographical memory remains remote autobiography under ordinary merge import.

# 22. Conformance Expectations

Profile conformance SHOULD test Experience/Step structural validity, failed Experience preservation, MnemonicState mutability, confidence/memory-strength separation, SkillUtility mutability, Skill authority non-amplification, Capsule portability, SelfModel non-authority, Commitment lifecycle, formation atomicity, and procedural provenance.

# 23. Profile Invariants

1. Experience and Skill are Profile concepts, not Core kinds.
2. Structural References do not automatically become Propositions.
3. `memory_strength` is not Assertion confidence.
4. `salience` is not source trust.
5. `utility` is not execution authority.
6. Person is not Principal.
7. SelfModel is not Governance.
8. SleepTask assignment is not permission.
9. Failed Experiences are valid memory.
10. One success does not prove a general Skill.
11. Derived summaries do not create independent Evidence roots.
12. Event and Experience are not interchangeable.
13. Temporal order does not imply causality.
14. Hidden chain-of-thought is not required.
15. Explicit correction preserves history.
16. Imported Skill remains non-authoritative by default.
17. Commitment expiry and retention expiry are distinct.
18. Read frequency is not a required mnemonic signal.
19. Profile Facets cannot override Core fields.
20. Brain algorithms remain outside Profile conformance.

# 24. Minimal Profile Primer

```text
Cognitive Memory Profile 2.0

Event: compact record of what happened
Experience: goal-directed state/action/observation trajectory
ExperienceStep: ordered observable step; no hidden chain-of-thought
caused_by: explicit effect→cause claim between steps; edge order alone is not causality
Insight: declarative lesson derived from memory
Skill: reusable procedure; content does not grant execution authority
Commitment: prospective memory
SelfModel: derived cognition about self; not Governance
MnemonicState: memory_strength + salience; not confidence
SkillUtility: procedural usefulness; not authority

Truth-sensitive claims use Proposition + Assertion + Evidence.
Transformations preserve Activity provenance.
```

# 25. Final Principle

> **A Cognitive Memory Profile should make the past structurally reusable without confusing memory accessibility, epistemic belief, autobiographical identity, or procedural usefulness with authority.**
